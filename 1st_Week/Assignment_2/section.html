                Hello! I'm Likhit Ajeesh, a sophomore in VIT, Vellore. I have a few
                years of experience in CS. During my 12th, I have done C++ programming &
                DBMS-MySQL. After joining VIT, I have done C, C++ and Python programming
                too. Right now, I'm learning MERN Stack. My plan is to enhance my
                coding, web development skills and explore every other domain of CS

            <h2>1. Usain Bolt</h2>
            <section class="align">
                <p>
                    Usain Bolt is the fastest human in history by average top speed. The
                    Jamaican was born in 1986 in Sherwood Content, a small town in
                    Northern Jamaica. . At the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in
                    Berlin, Germany, Usain Bolt set a new world record by running 100
                    meters in 9.58 seconds. A world record that remains unbroken to date.

            <h2>2. Yohan Blake</h2>
            <section class="align">
                <p>
                    Much like the fastest human on Earth, the second fastest is Jamaican
                    as well. Yohan Blake was born in 1989 in a small town in the Western
                    Jamaican Parish of Saint James. When Usain Bolt was once asked to name
                    the one human who could seriously challenge him, his answer was Yohan
                    Blake. Blake certainly came close when he ran 100 meters in 9.69
                    seconds at an athletics event in Lausanne, Switzerland.

            <h2>3. Tyson Gay</h2>
            <section class="align">
                <p>
                    Tyson Gay is the third fastest human and fastest non-Jamaican in
                    history. The American professional sprinter was born in 1982 in
                    Lexington, Kentucky. In 2009, at an athletics event in Shanghai,
                    China, Gay ran 100 meters in 9.69 seconds and is therefore practically
                    as fast as Yohan Blake. He is being ranked behind Blake only because
                    Gayâ€™s sprint was wind-assisted.
